## Building the Project

Follow these steps to build the project:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:
`bun start`
This will create a folder called `dist`.
4. Once the build is complete, open your browser.
5. Go to the extensions management page (usually found at `chrome://extensions/` for Chrome).
6. Activate `Developer Mode` (usually a toggle switch at the top right).
7. Click on `Load Unpacked`.
8. Navigate to the `dist` folder inside your project directory and select it.

Your extension should now be loaded in your browser.
